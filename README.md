   - **Repository**: Type `yourusername/climbing-logbook` (replace with your username)
   - **GitHub Personal Access Token**: Paste the token you just created
   - Click **"Test Connection"** to verify everything works
   - You should see "Connection successful! ‚úÖ"
   - Click **"Save & Continue"**

3. **Success!**
   - The setup section will disappear
   - You'll see tabs for Session, Climb, Training, and Edit
   - You're ready to start logging your climbing!

### Step 5: Updating Your App

When new features are released, you can merge updates from the main repository:

**‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT WARNING: Backup Your Data First!**
Before updating, save your climbing data as merging could potentially overwrite your JSON files:

1. **Download your data files** (if they exist):
   - Go to your repository's `data` folder
   - Right-click on `sessions.json` ‚Üí "Save link as..." (if it exists)
   - Right-click on `climbs.json` ‚Üí "Save link as..." (if it exists)  
   - Right-click on `training.json` ‚Üí "Save link as..." (if it exists)
   - Store these files safely on your computer

2. **Check for updates**:
   - Go to your forked repository on GitHub
   - Look for a message that says "This branch is X commits behind tupacamaruiv:main"
   - If you see this message, updates are available

3. **Sync with main repository**:
   - Click **"Sync fork"** button (appears when the main repo has updates)
   - Review the changes that will be merged
   - Click **"Update branch"** to merge the latest updates

4. **Verify your app still works**:
   - Wait 2-3 minutes for GitHub Pages to deploy the updates
   - Test your app at `https://yourusername.github.io/climbing-logbook`
   - Check that your data is still there in the Edit tab

5. **Restore data if needed**:
   - If any of your JSON files were overwritten (unlikely but possible):
   - Go to your repository's `data` folder
   - Click "Upload files" and re-upload your saved JSON files
   - Or copy/paste the content back into the files manually

*Note: We're working on a better solution that will protect your data automatically during updates.*

## Pro Tips for Best Results

### Consistent Boulder Naming
- **Use the suggested names**: The app shows recent boulder names as clickable tags
- **Be consistent**: "Crimpy Corner" and "crimpy corner" are treated as different routes
- **Descriptive names help**: Future you will thank you for clear naming

### Project Tracking Strategy
- ‚úÖ **Mark as "Project"** when you decide to work a boulder seriously over multiple sessions
- **Use the same exact boulder name** across all sessions for proper tracking 
- **Update notes** with progress on each attempt

### Mobile Gym Usage
- **Bookmark your app** (`https://yourusername.github.io/climbing-logbook`) for quick access
- **Log basic info quickly** at the gym, add videos/detailed notes later using Edit tab

### Data Organization
- **Log sessions first**, then add individual climbs to them
- **Use Edit tab** to add video links after uploading footage
- **Mark performance highlights** - they're great for tracking breakthrough moments

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### "App Won't Load" or Shows Blank Page
- **Wait longer**: GitHub Pages can take up to 10 minutes on first deploy
- **Check repository is public**: Go to your repo Settings ‚Üí scroll to bottom ‚Üí should show "Public repository"
- **Verify filename**: Must be exactly `index.html` in the root of your repository
- **Try incognito/private browsing**: Sometimes caching causes issues

### "Setup not complete" or Can't Save Data
- **Double-check repository name**: Should be exactly `yourusername/climbing-logbook`
- **Verify token permissions**: Token must have "repo" scope checked
- **Check token expiration**: Generate a new token if yours expired
- **Test connection**: Use the "Test Connection" button to verify setup

### "Please select a session first" Error
- **Log a session before logging climbs**: Climbs must be linked to sessions
- **Wait for session to appear**: Sometimes takes a moment for sessions to show in dropdown
- **Check session date**: Only recent sessions (past week) appear in dropdown

### Boulder Names Not Appearing as Suggestions
- **Log some climbs first**: The app learns names from your existing data
- **Use consistent spelling**: Small differences create separate names
- **Recent names appear as clickable tags**: Most recent 10 boulder names show below the input

### GitHub Token Issues
- **Token expired**: Generate a new one following Step 4 above
- **Wrong permissions**: Must check "repo" scope when creating token
- **Token not saved**: Make sure you copied the full token starting with `ghp_`
